# PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Dollar Funding MCA Application Processing System is a cloud-based solution designed to automate the processing of Merchant Cash Advance (MCA) applications. The system replaces manual data entry with automated document processing, reducing a 30-person team to 2 while improving accuracy and speed. Key features include:

- Automated email monitoring and document extraction
- AI-powered document classification and OCR processing
- Secure document storage and data management
- RESTful API integration with webhook support
- Web-based user interface for application management
- Comprehensive security and compliance features

The system is built using modern microservices architecture with Node.js, Python, Java, and React, deployed on AWS infrastructure using Kubernetes.
