# Kong API Gateway CORS Plugin Configuration
# Version: Kong 3.4.x
# Purpose: Configures secure cross-origin access for MCA application processing system

# Human Tasks:
# 1. Verify all domain names in 'origins' match production environment
# 2. Review and approve security headers configuration
# 3. Ensure max_age setting complies with security policy
# 4. Validate CORS configuration against security requirements

# Requirements Addressed:
# - API Security Architecture (4.4.2): Implements secure API access through WAF, API Gateway layer
# - API Architecture (5.3.1): Enables REST over HTTPS with secure cross-origin access control
# - Security Controls (7.3.2): Implements traffic filtering for API protection
